In this project I implemented a JWT authentification with refresh tokens and made a very naive payment process with Fake Bank API and Fake Payment Gateway. Both Bank and Gateway encrypt the sensitiv data (CVC). Bank only has 2 accounts test_belova@gmail.com (CVC 456) and test_johnwick@gmail.com (CVC 123) with some money. The Gateway acts as an intermediate between my Spring app and the Fake bank by creating a unique session basen on token in the database, generated by my Space Reservation Spring app (token is reservation ID). Based on this token Gateway encrypts the sensitive data (CVC). I also used Liquibase for Space Reservation Spring app and Bank.

Frontend Vue App:
